Hi! I'm Hamid Fazli! I'm interested in software engineering and artificial intelligence. 
I have a bachelor's degree in computer engineering from University of Tehran. My last two year GPA is 3.94/4 and overall is 3.66/4.

Also, I have experience of working on different types of industrial projects. If you want, you can see the most important of them in projects' tab. During last 4 years, my main focus was on learning both type of soft-skills and hard-skills.
Currently, I'm a software engineer, I think!

I use my time to learn new things about computers, humans, and society. In this website I share some of my thoughts. Feel free to read and comment.

Thanks!
