Hi! Welcome! 

Do you want to know more about me? 
So if you want, I have a bachelor of science degree in computer engineering from University of Tehran, and last two year GPA is 3.92/4 and my overall is 3.66/4.
Moreover, I have worked on different types of industrial projects which gave me valuable experience and skills, including soft-skills and hard-skills.
I'm interested in software engineering and artificial intelligence, and I really enjoy when I use my time to learn more about these areas. 

But, the computers aren't the only things that I care, and I like to know more about humanity, and society. 

I shared some of my thoughts in this website. Feel free to read and comment.
