description: A brief description and source code

I have used random forest classifier to compete in this challenge.
Also, I have tried other types of classifiers such as K-Nearest-Neighbor and Decision tree. 
But, the result of random forest was better than others.

You can my source code here: <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/hfkh77/titanic-compeition">https://www.kaggle.com/hfkh77/titanic-compeition</a>
My best score: 0.75358

Looking for better solution? 
I haven't seen any of them, 
but when you check the leaderboard, 
you see that a lot of people could get 1.0 score which seems really amazing!
