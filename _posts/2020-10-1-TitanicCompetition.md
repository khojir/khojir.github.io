If you are interested in machine learning, you need to get hands-on experience on different types of data. Just knowing different algorithms and theories isn't enough.
One of the best places to show your knowledge to the world is kaggle. It's a place where you can compete with other people and learn together.
The Kaggle's community is really friendly, and people like to share their knowledge with each other.
Currently you can find different online competitions in this website. If you are new to kaggle, I suggest trying 'The Titanic' competition. I hope you get really good results in it!
Compete and have fun! :))
