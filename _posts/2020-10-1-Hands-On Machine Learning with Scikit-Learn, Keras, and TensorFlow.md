description: Maybe the best book to learn ML
---
Currently, everybody talks about ML. 
We see a lot of students who like to learn AI and ML. 
Also, every day a lot of companies and authors publish different courses and books about ML. 
So, we can find a lot of valuable resources.

One of these resources is a book which its name is “Hands-On Machine Learning with Scikit-Learn, Keras, and TensorFlow”. 
I highly recommend this book to people who all already familiar with programming and python language. 
This is a fantastic book that teaches you theories and implementation at the same time.
